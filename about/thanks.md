The FOLIO Project is grateful for support from **BrowserStack**.
[BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com) enables the FOLIO Project front end developers to automate the tests of changes to user interface code across a variety of browsers.
The project also uses BrowserStack to ensure the proper flow of user interface elements around translated strings of various lengths.
