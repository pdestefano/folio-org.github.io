## Community representatives

The FOLIO community consists of many significant contributors.  Among
them are community representatives which include:

- Sebastian Hammer, Index Data
- Christopher Spalding, EBSCO
- Michael Winkler, OLE

## Engineering teams

The FOLIO developer community consists of:

- Index Data, which leads the technical development of the FOLIO
  software
- Several software engineering teams
- Contributing developers from the community
- Many supporting individuals whose contributions feed into and guide
  the development process

Here we list the engineering roles and contacts for the various parts of
the project.  Team members can be contacted via the collaboration tools

### Engineering core team

The engineering core team sets strategic direction for technical
architecture in the FOLIO software:

- Sebastian Hammer (project lead)

### Subproject core teams

Several components of the FOLIO software are distinct subprojects and
have a core team of software engineers with commit-level access to the
source code repositories.  Each subproject generally has a lead
developer who is responsible for selecting new core team members from
the community.
