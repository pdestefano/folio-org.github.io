title: Primer for frontend development

Start with introduction to [user interface](/doc/#user-interface)
and the [client-side](/source-code/#client-side) source code repositories.

That leads to the Stripes [Documentation Roadmap](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes-core/blob/master/README.md#documentation-roadmap) and overview of the main docs, and necessary background understanding.

Eventually go via the foundation described in
[The Stripes Module Developer's Guide](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes-core/blob/master/doc/dev-guide.md)
to
[Skeleton module](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes-core/blob/master/doc/dev-guide.md#skeleton-module).
